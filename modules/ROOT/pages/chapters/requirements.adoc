= Requirements to use DXM
Crownpeak's DXM CMS lives in the cloud, accessible by the following browsers. There is no installation required.

Supported browsers::
* Microsoft Edge
* Google Chrome
* Safari

URL access::
Every customer has a unique instance URL. For example: \https://cms.crownpeak.net/[customername]/

// 

Support::
* If you're a new user, you should use the temporary password received by email and follow the instructions to reset and login.
* If you're a developer, you'll use the same username and password you use today for Desktop Connection.
* If you are not sure about your unique URL or if you encounter any issues, create a support case or contact your customer success manager.
